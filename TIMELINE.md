# 🧭 TIMELINE.md  
> My journey from a PHP developer to a full-stack engineer & self-hosted cloud architect

---

## 🐣 2020 - 2024: The Beginning

- Learned **PHP**, **JavaScript**, **CSS**, and **Python**
- Built my first self-hosted **home server**
- Deployed full-stack web apps using PHP and **PostgreSQL**
- Set up my own **RTMP streaming server** for custom video broadcasting
- Explored **Linux** briefly for server hosting

---

## 🚀 Early 2025: Leveling Up

- Learned **React**, **Next.js**, and **Bun**
- Separated frontend and backend into clean service layers using API-based architecture
- Adopted **TypeScript** and **modern frontend tooling**
- Learned **Docker** & **Docker Swarm**:
  - Built and deployed my first **MySQL cluster** with Swarm for load balancing
- Got serious with **Linux**:
  - Fully migrated from Windows Server to **Linux-based infrastructure** (Alpine, Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat)

## ⚙️ Mid April 2025: The DevOps Era

- Learned **Kubernetes** with HPA and clustering
- Integrated with my self-hosted **pfSense firewall**
- Built:
  - A **MariaDB Galera** self-healing cluster
  - A **Redis cluster** for caching high-traffic endpoints
- Created a **Kubernetes CronJob** to:
  - Backup databases at **3 AM daily**
  - Send to a **self-hosted FTP server**

- Storage Evolution:
  - Switched from **Longhorn**
  - Now using **OpenEBS** as my primary K8s storage engine

## 🔬 Experiments & Exploration

- Tried deploying **ScyllaDB** for ultra-fast NoSQL workloads
  - Learned that **SSD is essential** for NoSQL DBs like Scylla (running on old HDDs causes bottlenecks)
- Built my **new mail server stack**:
  - Fully secured with **Rspamd**, **TLS**, **firewalls**, and **Linux hardening**
  - Migrated from old **hMailServer on Windows** to modern Linux setup
  - Blocked phishing mail 🚫
